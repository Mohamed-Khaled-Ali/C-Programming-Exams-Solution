# C-Programming-Exams-Solution
It contains many tests in C, Most of these tests are designed and solved on the Code Blocks program. Inside each code you will find a comment explaining the test or questions, and then you will find the solution. I hope this will be useful in your trainingin your study of the C programming language.

# How-It-Works
While studying the C programming language, I had a problem when doing any project, which is that I could not build a planning idea or build a plan for programming the code, due to not solving many exercises in the language. So I searched for tests in the language about almost everything in it, and I divided them and solved them. After that, I decided to put them here in gethup so that others can benefit from them first, and so that they can be a reference for me, and in the future, they will be an important memory that I solved all these tests.

Okay enough talk let's start ..... 

Initially, you will find all tests divided into more than one category, for example (If - For -Loops) and so on. Within each category, there are many tests divided from 1 to the end of the tests, and they increase in difficulty as the number increases.

When you open any test, you will find a comment at the beginning explaining what you should do to solve this test, and then you will find the solution below.
Always try to solve it yourself first before you see the answer so that you can take full advantage.
Always if your solution works it is good even if it is different from the solution here
But there is always a better solution in terms of code size, number of lines, code effectiveness in work and avoiding errors
But as a start if the code does what is required of it correctly then this is very good

Continue improving....
